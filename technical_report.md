### (Issue with error codes)

(A code snippet example demonstrating the feature - 1 mark)

``` javascript

RESPONSE_CODES = {
    200: 'OK',
    201: 'Created',
    204: 'No Content',
    301: 'Moved Permanently',

    500: 'Internal Server Error',
    501: 'Not Implemented',
}
```
(Explain why this pattern is problematic - 40ish words 1 mark)
